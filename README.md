## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Explore student data to uncover patterns affecting academic performance
  
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
  
- Use visualizations to identify correlations between features and grades
  
- Apply machine learning models to predict and explain performance
  
- Create an interactive dashboard for deeper stakeholder insights

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
  
- **Power BI**: for interactive dashboard and data storytelling
  
- **GitHub**: version control and project portfolio

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features (Power BI)

- Overview cards: Avg Grade, % Internet Access, Study Time Distribution
  
- Filters: Gender, Internet, Romantic Relationship, Alcohol Use
  
- Visuals:
  
  - Performance by Gender & Study Time
    
  - Absences vs Grades (scatter plot)
    
  - Daily vs Weekend Alcohol vs Performance (heatmap)
    
  - Clustering (High Risk / Average / Disciplined students)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Insights (Python)

- Feature Importance using Random Forest
  
- Logistic Regression for binary classification of performance (High vs Low)
  
- KMeans Clustering: Grouped students based on study behavior and risk factors
  
- Pairplots and heatmaps for correlation analysis

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)
  
- Contains data from Portuguese students related to demographics, lifestyle, and school performance.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Study Time and Parental Education show positive correlation with performance
  
- Romantic relationships and high alcohol consumption correlate with lower grades
   
- Internet access, school support, and absences also show strong trends
  
- Clustering can reveal student risk profiles for targeted interventions

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add deployment to Power BI Service
  
- Automate grade prediction in real-time
  
- Integrate survey-based data for a broader perspective
